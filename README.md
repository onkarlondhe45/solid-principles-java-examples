# SOLID Principles in Java (Examples)

This repository contains examples of the **SOLID Design Principles** implemented in Java. Each principle is demonstrated with **bad** and **good** examples to explain why SOLID is important.

## üìñ What are SOLID Principles?

SOLID is an acronym for five important design principles in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that help create **flexible**, **scalable**, and **maintainable** software.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ S ‚Äî Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
- **Why?** Reduces complexity, makes code easier to maintain and test.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ O ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Definition:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be **open for extension but closed for modification**.
- **Why?** New features can be added without breaking existing code.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ L ‚Äî Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Definition:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- **Why?** Ensures that derived classes extend base classes without changing their behavior.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ I ‚Äî Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Definition:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Why?** Prevents implementing unnecessary methods and keeps interfaces focused.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ D ‚Äî Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Definition:** High-level modules should depend on **abstractions**, not concrete classes.
- **Why?** Makes the system flexible, decoupled, and easy to test.

## üí° Why use SOLID Principles?

1. **Maintainability:** Code is easier to modify and fix bugs without breaking other parts.  
2. **Reusability:** Components can be reused in other projects.  
3. **Scalability:** Easier to extend features without rewriting existing logic.  
4. **Testability:** Classes are smaller and isolated, making unit testing easier.  
5. **Flexibility:** System can adapt to future changes with minimal effort.
